# _**<h1>Capstone Proposal**_

### **Tristan Emmerson**

### Project: Stickerslug

<h1></h1>

## **Purpose/Goal:**

<h1></h1>
Create a queryable product database API for a business, and the client companion for interfacing with the database. This project is one that I wish I had the skills to write while I was running my business. This database problem was the impetus to my entering programming. Currently all the data resides in various csv's.

MVP:

A database that is single-field queryable for "raw data" of a parent product sku.
Products information is queryable at a basal serial level.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Firebase/MySQL Workbench/PostgresSQL for database API
- React for the client to interface with API
- VSCode to write it all
- Bootstrap to make it pretty

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Seed some portion of child data points for variants
- Add photo representation of queried product.
- Add marketplace specified field headers for parent data.
- Create exportable reports that interface with various marketplaces (amz/etsy/ebay/.com) and follow their product data format.
- Interface with AMZ SellerCentral API for product information update.
- admin authentication

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- AMZ S3
- Seller Central API
- eBay API
- Etsy API (I don't think this one actually exists, but possibly 3rd-party)
- Entity framework

* Career Services

  - Research internship companies
  - Rank internship companies
  - finish writing out your pitch notes and time yourself
  - email nina final pieces 10/7 (i think, check on this)
  - final pass through of linked-in
  - final pass through of generic resume'

* General

  - read about Effect Hook
  - ~~Re-read thinking in React~~
  - look into charts.js
  - look into D3.js
  - Consider exporting reports with BigQuery: Connected Sheets

* Data
  - ~~combine country comparison~~

- ~~find main product data~~

<p>i cant solve how to efficiency upload all this product data. i think i can write some 
middleware (i think that's what it would be) to handle that. just pass the json data in.</p>

- ~~move data into assets~~
- ~~move index into assets~~
- ~~move package into assets~~
- ~~move package-lock into assets~~
- ~~move serviceAccountKey into assets~~

* total side thought: I need to quick netlify those domains i have sitting in 101

* write middleware index
* integrate peripherals for middleware
* ~~swap favicon out~~
