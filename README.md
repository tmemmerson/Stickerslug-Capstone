# _--<h1>Capstone: Stickerslug--_

### --Tristan Emmerson--

<h1></h1>

<h1 align="left">
Purpose/Goal:</h1>
- As an admin I want to be able to delete the hundreds of spreadsheets I am currently using to manage all of our product data
- As an admin I want to be able to inventorize all of my product data
- As an admin I want to be able to query data at a granular level (deep skus)
- As an admin I want to be able to query more complex ranges of products by field data

Pain Point: As my business scaled over the years, my inventory system could not keep pace with the quantity of products Stickerslug was offering. Updating and making changes became arduous and time-consuming.

<h1></h1>

<h1 align="left">
MVP:</h1>

A database that is single-field queryable for "raw data" of a parent product sku.
Products information is queryable at a basal serial level.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Firebase database
- React client interface
- VSCode to write it all
- Bootstrap to make it pretty

<h1></h1>

<h1 align="left">
Stretch Goals:</h1>

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Seed some portion of child data points for variants
- Add photo representation of queried product.
- Add marketplace specified field headers for parent data.
- Create exportable reports that interface with various marketplaces (amz/etsy/ebay/.com) and follow their product data format.
- Interface with AMZ SellerCentral API for product information update.
- admin authentication

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- AMZ S3
- Seller Central API
- eBay API
- Etsy API (I don't think this one actually exists, but possibly 3rd-party)
- Entity framework

- ~~find main product data~~

<p>i cant solve how to efficiency upload all this product data. i think i can write some 
middleware (i think that's what it would be) to handle that. just pass the json data in.</p>
